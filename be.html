<!--
HTML entities are special codes that are used to represent characters that cannot be typed directly into HTML code. 
These characters include special symbols, accented letters, and non-breaking spaces. There are two ways to represent HTML entities:
Entity names: These are the names of the characters, such as "&amp;" for the ampersand symbol.
Entity numbers: These are the Unicode code points of the characters, such as "&#38;" for the ampersand symbol.

HTML entities are often used to prevent browsers from interpreting certain characters as HTML tags.
For example, the less-than sign (<) is a reserved character in HTML, so if you want to display it in your text, 
you need to use the entity code "&lt;". Otherwise, the browser might think that you are trying to start a new tag.

Here are some common HTML entities:

<: Represents the less than sign (<).
>: Represents the greater than sign (>).
&: Represents the ampersand (&) itself.
": Represents a double quotation mark (").
': Represents a single quotation mark (').

For special characters with diacritical marks or accent symbols, you can use entities like:
é: Represents the letter "e".
ñ: Represents the letter "n".

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML entities</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Amersand symbol: &amp; or &#38</p>
</body>
</html>


<!--
&amp;: This is the named entity for the ampersand (&) symbol.
&#38;: This is the numeric entity reference for the same ampersand (&) symbol. 
Both achieve the same result but are written differently. Using HTML entities ensures that special characters like the ampersand, 
which have special meanings in HTML, are rendered correctly instead of being interpreted as code.


Here’s a breakdown of your HTML code that demonstrates the use of HTML entities:

HTML Structure
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type as HTML5.
<html lang="en">: Starts the root HTML element, specifying the language of the document as English.
<head>: Contains metadata about the webpage, such as the title and character encoding.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: 
Ensures proper rendering and scaling on different devices by setting the viewport.
<title>HTML entities</title>: Sets the title of the webpage to "HTML entities", which appears in the browser tab.

Body Content
<body>: Begins the body section, where the visible content of the page is placed.
<p>: Starts a paragraph.
Amersand symbol:: The text displayed as the label before the ampersand symbol.
&amp;: Represents the ampersand symbol (&) using the HTML entity &amp;. HTML entities are used to display special characters in HTML.
or: A conjunction to introduce another method for representing the ampersand symbol.
&#38;: Another way to represent the ampersand (&) using its numeric character reference. &#38; is numeric code that corresponds to the ampersand.
</p>: Closes the paragraph tag.

Closing Tags
</body>: Closes the body section of the HTML document.
</html>: Closes the entire HTML document.
