HTML lists are used to display a series of items in a logical order. There are three main types of HTML lists:

Ordered lists (<ol> tags) are used to display a list of items in a numbered order.
Unordered lists (<ul> tags) are used to display a list of items in a bulleted list.
Definition lists (<dl> tags) are used to display a list of terms and their definitions.

Each list item is enclosed in a <li> tag. The <li> tag can contain any type of HTML content, including text, images, and other elements.

Let's understand the Types of lists:

Ordered List (<ol>): An ordered list is a list of items that are sequentially numbered. 
The order matters, and the list items are automatically numbered in ascending order.

Unordered List (<ul>): An unordered list is a list of items where the order doesn't matter, 
and the list items are typically represented with bullet points.

Description List (<dl>): A description list consists of a list of terms and their corresponding descriptions. 
It uses the <dt> tag for the term and the <dd> tag for the description.


HTML lists are a versatile way to display information on a web page. They can be used to present a series of items in a logical order,
or to provide definitions of terms.

This HTML file demonstrates how to create three types of lists: an ordered list, an unordered list, and a description list. 
The ordered list is numbered, while the unordered list uses bullet points. The description list consists of terms (defined using <dt>) 
and their definitions (provided with <dd>), allowing for structured presentation of information.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the HTML file that creates ordered, unordered, and description lists:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares that the document is using HTML5.

<html lang="en">: Defines the root of the HTML document, with lang="en" indicating that the language is English.

<head>: Contains meta-information about the document.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8 to support a wide range of characters.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:
Ensures the page is responsive by setting the viewport properties to match the device's width.

<title>HTML lists</title>: Sets the title of the webpage to "HTML lists," which appears in the browser tab.

</head>: Ends the head section.

<body>: Begins the body section where visible content is placed.

<h2>Ordered list</h2>: This <h2> tag creates a subheading for the ordered list section.

<ol>: Starts an ordered list (numbered list).
<li>Item1</li>: Defines a list item for the ordered list as "Item1."
<li>Item2</li>: Defines a list item for the ordered list as "Item2."
<li>Item3</li>: Defines a list item for the ordered list as "Item3."
</ol>: Closes the ordered list.

<h2>Unordered list</h2>: This <h2> tag creates a subheading for the unordered list section.

<ul>: Starts an unordered list (bulleted list).
<li>Item1</li>: Defines a list item for the unordered list as "Item1."
<li>Item2</li>: Defines a list item for the unordered list as "Item2."
<li>Item3</li>: Defines a list item for the unordered list as "Item3."
</ul>: Closes the unordered list.

<h2>Discription list</h2>: This <h2> tag creates a subheading for the description list section.

<dl>: Starts a description list, which consists of terms and their definitions.
<dt>Term1</dt>: Defines a term (description list item) as "Term1."
<dd>Definiton of Term1</dd>: Provides the definition of "Term1."
<dt>Term2</dt>: Defines a term as "Term2."
<dd>Definiton of Term2</dd>: Provides the definition of "Term2."
<dt>Term3</dt>: Defines a term as "Term3."
<dd>Definiton of Term3</dd>: Provides the definition of "Term3."
</dl>: Closes the description list.

</body>: Ends the body section.

</html>: Closes the HTML document.
