This HTML file contains two headings. The first (h1) is displayed without any additional styling, 
while the second (h2) uses inline CSS to change its font size to 24 pixels and its color to a custom blue using the rgb() function. 
Inline styles allow you to apply specific styles directly within an HTML tag.
