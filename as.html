<!--
HTML file paths are used to specify the location of external resources, such as images, CSS files, 
JavaScript files, and other assets, on a web page. The browser uses the file path to find the resource and load it into the web page.

There are three main types of file paths used in HTML:

Absolute File Paths: An absolute file path provides the full URL or file system path from the root of the web server or local file system. 
Absolute paths start with the scheme (e.g.. "http://" for web URLs or "file://" for local file paths).
Example
<img src="https://www.example.com/images/image.jpg" alt="Image">

Relative File Paths: A relative file path provides location of the resource relative to the current HTML file or the current working directory. 
Relative paths are commonly used when referencing resources within the same website or project.
Example
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">

This HTML file includes:
A hyperlink to Google that opens in a new tab.
An image with a relative file path (/images/logo-2582748_640.webp), assuming that the images folder is in the root directory. 
The image is displayed at 400x400 pixels and has both alternative text for accessibility and a tooltip for user interaction.


Here’s a line-by-line breakdown of the HTML file that demonstrates how to create a hyperlink and use a relative file path for an image:

<!DOCTYPE html>:
Specifies that the document is HTML5.

<html lang="en">:
Opens the HTML document and sets the language to English.

<head>:
This section contains meta-information, such as the document title and character settings.

<meta charset="UTF-8">:
Defines the character encoding as UTF-8 for proper text rendering.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:
Ensures responsive design by scaling the page on different devices.

<title>HTML File Paths</title>:
Sets the title of the webpage to "HTML File Paths," which appears in the browser tab.

</head>:
Closes the head section.

<body>:
Opens the body section, where the content visible on the webpage is defined.

<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Visit google website</a>:
Creates a hyperlink:
href="https://google.com" specifies the URL (Google in this case).
target="_blank" ensures the link opens in a new tab.
The text "Visit google website" is clickable and leads to Google.

<img src="/images/HTMLlogo.webp" height="400" width="400" alt="html image" title="Sample image.">:
This line adds an image using a relative file path:
src="/images/HTMLlogo.webp" defines the path to the image file. 
In this case, it is a relative path pointing to a folder named images located in the root directory. The file is HTMLlogo.webp.
height="400" and width="400" set the image dimensions to 400x400 pixels.
alt="html image" provides alternative text in case the image doesn’t load, useful for accessibility.
title="Sample image." adds a tooltip that appears when the user hovers over the image.

</body>:
Closes the body section.

</html>:
Closes the HTML document.
