HTML structures the content. CSS styles the content. JavaScript adds interactivity to the content.
Together, they create a complete and interactive web experience.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are three fundamental technologies used in web development, each serving a distinct purpose:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Purpose: HTML is used to structure the content of a webpage. 
It defines the elements on the page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other types of content.
Functionality: HTML uses tags to create elements. For example, <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, and <a> for links.
Example:
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Purpose: CSS is used to style the visual presentation of a webpage. It controls layout, colors, fonts, and overall design.
Functionality: CSS can be applied to HTML elements using selectors and properties. 
It allows for responsive design and ensures a consistent look across different devices.
Example:
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
p {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

JavaScript:
Purpose: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to webpages. It allows 
for manipulation of the HTML and CSS, enabling features like animations, form validation, and content updates without reloading the page.
Functionality: JavaScript can respond to user events (like clicks or key presses), 
manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and make asynchronous requests to servers.
Example:
document.querySelector("h1").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Heading clicked!");
});


Key Differences
Nature:
HTML is a markup language for structuring content.
CSS is a stylesheet language for presentation and layout.
JavaScript is a programming language for interactivity and functionality.

Functionality:
HTML provides the skeleton of a webpage.
CSS styles the skeleton, making it visually appealing.
JavaScript makes the webpage interactive and dynamic.

Use Cases:
HTML is used to create elements and content.
CSS is used to format and design those elements.
JavaScript is used to add behavior and responsiveness to the elements.

The Live Server extension is a popular tool for web developers, particularly when working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects in VS Code. 
It is a development tool that allows developers to launch local web server and view their web pages in real-time as they make changes to the code.
This is particularly useful for web development, as it provides immediate feedback without the need to refresh the browser manually
Here's a breakdown of what it is, its features, and how to use it:

Definition: Live Server is an extension for Visual Studio Code that enables a local development server with live reload capabilities. 
It allows you to view your web applications in real-time as you make changes to your code.
Purpose: It helps streamline the development process by automatically refreshing the browser whenever you save changes to your files, 
providing instant feedback and a smoother workflow.

Key Features
Live Reload: Automatically reloads the webpage in the browser when you save changes to your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.
Local Development Server: Hosts your project files locally, making them accessible via a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:5500).
Browser Syncing: You can sync multiple browsers or devices to see changes in real time across all of them.
Customizable Settings: You can configure the port, open browser settings, and other preferences according to your needs.

How to Install Live Server
Open Visual Studio Code: Launch VS Code on your computer.
Go to Extensions: Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or press Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for Live Server: Type "Live Server" in the search bar.
Install the Extension: Click the Install button on the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey.

How to Use Live Server
Open Your Project: Open the folder containing your web project in VS Code.
Start Live Server: Right-click on your index.html (or any HTML file) in the Explorer panel and select "Open with Live Server".
Alternatively, you can click the "Go Live" button in the status bar at the bottom of VS Code.
View in Browser: Your default web browser will open, displaying your webpage. 
As you edit your files and save them, the browser will automatically refresh to reflect the changes.

Benefits of Using Live Server
Faster Development: Instant feedback saves time and enhances productivity.
Simplified Workflow: No need to manually refresh the browser after each change.
Better Testing: Test your web applications in real-time without deploying them to a server.

Conclusion
The Live Server extension is an invaluable tool for web developers, making it easier to build and test web applications. 
It simplifies the development process by providing a local server environment with live reload capabilities, 
ultimately enhancing productivity and user experience.


"Go Live" is a feature in VS Code provided by the Live Server extension. It allows you to instantly launch a local development server 
for your web project. When you click the "Go Live" button, your project is served on a local server, 
and the browser automatically opens, showing your web page with live reload functionality.

The 5500 port is the default network port that the Live Server extension in VS Code uses to host your local web development server. 
A port is a communication endpoint in networking. Ports allow computers to differentiate between multiple applications or services running 
on the same device. Each port is identified by a unique number (0 to 65535). Common examples are port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS.
