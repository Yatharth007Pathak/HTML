<!--
In HTML, iframes are used to embed another HTML document within the current document. This allows you to display content from 
other websites or resources directly on your webpage. The content displayed in an iframe behaves like an independent document, 
and users can interact with it as if it were loaded in a separate browser window.

Here's the basic syntax for using iframes: <iframe src="URL"></iframe>
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML iframe</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Embedded Google Map</h1>    
    <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d27748.336214319163!2d79.6634012743164!3d29.616996800000006!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x39a0b7ac9c83d86d%3A0xde05dfded20abe9c!2sChitai%20Golu%20Devta%20Temple!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1728557311230!5m2!1sen!2sin" width="400" height="300" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

This HTML file embeds a Google Map using an iframe, displaying the location of Chitai Golu Devta Temple. 
The map is configured with a width of 400 pixels, a height of 300 pixels, no border, and lazy loading for performance optimization. 
There is also a heading above the map titled "Embedded Google Map."
The iframe element is a powerful tool for embedding external resources like maps, videos, or entire websites within your webpage.
