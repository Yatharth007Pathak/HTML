/*
This is a CSS rule for styling all <p> (paragraph) elements on the webpage. 
This CSS rule will style all paragraphs by making their text size larger (24px), setting their background color to green, 
text color to white, and applying a 5% margin around each paragraph. The margins will provide spacing from other elements on the page.


Letâ€™s break down each property within the rule:

p:
The selector p targets all paragraph (<p>) elements in the HTML document. 
The styles defined inside the curly braces will be applied to every paragraph.

font-size: 24px;:
This sets the size of the text within the paragraph to 24 pixels. It controls how large the text inside <p> elements will appear.

margin: 5%;:
This sets the margin (space around the paragraph) to 5% of the width of the containing element (e.g., the browser window). 
This applies the margin equally on all four sides of the paragraph (top, right, bottom, and left).

background-color: green;:
This sets the background color of the paragraph to green. 
The entire area of the paragraph, including the space within the margins, will have this background color.

color: white;:
This sets the text color inside the paragraph to white, making it stand out against the green background.
