HTML Emojis are graphical symbols that are used to express emotions, ideas, and objects. 
They are a popular way to add visual interest and personality to web pages.

There are two ways to add emojis to HTML documents:

Using Unicode characters: Emojis are represented by Unicode characters. You can use these characters directly in your HTML code. 
For example, the laughing face emoji can be represented using the unicode character entity &#x1F600;.

Using Named Character Entities: Some emojis have named character entities that can be used directly in HTML. 
For example, the smiley face emoji can be represented using the named character entity &amp;#x1F60A; or its short form &amp;#128522;.

This document demonstrates how to use Unicode numeric character references to display emojis in HTML. You can use either:
Hexadecimal references like &#x1F600; for the "grinning face" emoji (ðŸ˜€).
Decimal references like &#128522; for the "smiling face" emoji (ðŸ˜Š).
Both hexadecimal and decimal references are valid ways to display emojis in HTML.


Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of your HTML code using emojis:

HTML Structure
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type as HTML5.
<html lang="en">: Begins the root HTML element, indicating that the language of the document is English.
<head>: This section contains metadata about the document, like the title and character encoding.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters, including emojis.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: 
Ensures proper scaling and responsiveness of the webpage across different devices.
<title>HTML Emojis</title>: Defines the title of the page, which is "HTML Emojis".

Body Content
<body>: Begins the body section of the HTML document, where the visible content is placed.

<p>Here's a laughing face emoji: &#x1F600;</p>: 
This displays a paragraph with the text "Here's a laughing face emoji" followed by a laughing face emoji.
The entity &#x1F600; is a hexadecimal representation of the Unicode character for the "grinning face" emoji (ðŸ˜€).

<p>Here's a smiley face emoji: &#128522; or &#x1F60A;</p>:
Displays a paragraph with the text "Here's a smiley face emoji" followed by the smiley face emoji.
&#128522; is the decimal code for the "smiling face" emoji (ðŸ˜Š), while &#x1F60A; is its hexadecimal equivalent.

Closing Tags
