<!--
Here's an example of an HTML element with attributes:

<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Visit Google Website</a>

In this example, the <a> element is an anchor (link), and it has two attributes:
href: This attribute defines the URL to which the link points. 
When users click on the link, they will be redirected to the specified URL ("https://www.google.com" in this case).
target: This attribute specifies how the linked page should open. 
In this case, the value _blank indicates that the link should open in a new browser tab or window.

This HTML file demonstrates how to use the <a> tag with the target="_blank" attribute to create a hyperlink that opens in a new tab. 
The link points to YouTube’s website (https://youtube.com), and when clicked, the webpage will open in a new tab 
without closing or leaving the current page. The text "Visit youtube website" is displayed as the clickable link.


Here’s a detailed line-by-line breakdown of the HTML file that demonstrates how to create a hyperlink that opens in a new tab:

<!DOCTYPE html>:
This declaration specifies that the document is an HTML5 document, ensuring that browsers render it correctly.

<html lang="en">:
This is the opening tag for the HTML document, with the lang attribute set to "en," indicating that the content is primarily in English.

<head>:
This section contains meta-information about the document, including the title and character settings.

<meta charset="UTF-8">:
This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document, ensuring that text is displayed correctly using the UTF-8 character set.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:
This meta tag sets the viewport for responsive design, ensuring that the webpage scales correctly on different devices, especially mobile.

<title>HTML links</title>:
This tag sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab. Here, the title is "HTML links."

</head>:
This closing tag marks the end of the head section.

<body>:
This opening tag begins the body section, where the visible content of the webpage is placed.

<a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">Visit youtube website</a>:
This line demonstrates how to create a hyperlink that opens in a new tab:
The href="https://youtube.com" attribute defines the URL the link will navigate to when clicked. 
In this case, it links to YouTube's website (https://youtube.com).
The target="_blank" attribute specifies that the link should open in a new tab (or new window, depending on the browser's behavior). 
This is useful when you want users to keep the current page open while they visit another site.
The text between the opening and closing <a> tags, "Visit youtube website," is what the user will see and click on.
When the user clicks this link, YouTube's website will open in a new browser tab.

</body>:
This closing tag marks the end of the body section of the document.

</html>:
This closing tag indicates the end of the HTML document.
