In HTML, colors can be represented using various formats. The most common ways to specify colors are using named colors, 
hexadecimal values, RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values, and HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lighness) values.
Here's an overview of each method:

Named colors: The HTML provides a set of predefined color names that you can use directly.

Hexadecimal colors: Hexadecimal values represent colors using a combination of 6 characters, where each pair of characters represents the
intensity of red, green and blue components. The format is #RRGGBB, where RR is red component, GG is green component, and BB is blue component. 
Each component can have values from 00 to FF (in hexadecimal), where 00 is the lowest intensity(0) and FF is the highest intensity(255)

RGB Colors: RGB values represent colors using 3 integers, each representing the intensity of red, green and blue components.
THe format is rgb (red, green, blue), where, red, green and blue are integers in the range of 0 to 255.

HSL colors: HSL values represent colors using 3 components: Hue (the type of color), Saturation (the vividness of the color),
and lightness (the brightness of color). The format is hsl (hue, saaturation, lightness).

This HTML file demonstrates different ways to define text colors using inline CSS within paragraphs. It showcases:
Standard color names (red), Hexadecimal color codes (#00FF00 for green), RGB color values (rgb(0, 0, 255) for blue), and
HSL values (hsl(60, 100%, 50%) for yellow). Each paragraph displays a different color based on the method used for color definition, 
providing a practical example of how colors can be applied in HTML/CSS.


Hereâ€™s a detailed line-by-line breakdown of the provided HTML file that demonstrates different color definitions in CSS:

<!DOCTYPE html>:
This declaration indicates that the document is an HTML5 document, ensuring that browsers render it correctly.

<html lang="en">:
This is the opening tag for the HTML document, with the lang attribute set to "en," specifying that the content is primarily in English.

<head>:
This section contains meta-information about the document, including the title and character settings.

<meta charset="UTF-8">:
This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document, ensuring that text is displayed correctly using the UTF-8 character set.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:
This meta tag sets the viewport settings for responsive design. 
It ensures that the webpage scales correctly on different devices, particularly on mobile.

<title>HTML colors</title>:
This tag sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab. Here, the title is "HTML colors."

</head>:
This closing tag marks the end of the head section.

<body>:
This opening tag begins the body section, where the visible content of the webpage is placed.

<p style="color: red;">This text is red using normal color.</p>:
This paragraph (<p>) contains inline CSS with the style attribute:
color: red; sets the text color to red using a standard color name.
The text "This text is red using normal color." will be displayed in red.

<p style="color: #00FF00;">This text is green using hexadecimal color.</p>:
This paragraph also contains inline CSS:
color: #00FF00; uses a hexadecimal color code to set the text color to green.
The hex code #00FF00 represents bright green.
The text "This text is green using hexadecimal color." will be displayed in green.

<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">This text is blue using RGB color.</p>:
This paragraph demonstrates the RGB color model:
color: rgb(0, 0, 255); sets the text color to blue, with the red and green components set to 0 and the blue component set to 255.
The text "This text is blue using RGB color." will be displayed in blue.

<p style="color: hsl(60, 100%, 50%);"> This text is yellow using HSL color.</p>:
This paragraph shows the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model:
color: hsl(60, 100%, 50%); sets the text color to yellow, where 60 is the hue (representing yellow), 
100% is the saturation (full color), and 50% is the lightness (medium brightness).
The text "This text is yellow using HSL color." will be displayed in yellow.

</body>:
This closing tag marks the end of the body section of the document.

</html>:
This closing tag indicates the end of the HTML document.
