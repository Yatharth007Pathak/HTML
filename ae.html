In addition to index.html, there are several other common file names used in HTML projects to organize and structure the various pages 
and resources of a website. Each file typically has a specific purpose, often corresponding to different sections of a site or functionality. 
Common HTML Files are:

about.html: This file typically contains information about the website or the organization behind it. 
It’s often linked from the "About Us" section of a website.

contact.html: Used for contact information, eg forms for visitors to get in touch with site owners, address details, email, or phone numbers.

services.html or products.html: Describes the services or products offered by a business or organization.

portfolio.html: This page showcases the work, projects, or portfolio of a company, artist, or developer.

blog.html: Lists blog posts or articles. Each individual post may also have its own file (e.g., post1.html, post2.html).

gallery.html: Contains an image or video gallery. Often used by photographers, artists, or media-rich sites.

faq.html: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page that provides answers to common questions about the website, services, or products.

login.html: This page contains a login form for users to sign in to their accounts.

signup.html or register.html: Contains a form for users to create an account on the website.

404.html: This is a special page that displays when a user tries to access a page that does not exist (i.e., a 404 error page).


In addition to HTML files, websites often include other types of files that work alongside the HTML to create a complete web experience.

CSS Files:
styles.css or main.css: These files contain the styles (colors, fonts, layouts) used across the website.
reset.css or normalize.css: Used to reset or standardize default browser styles.

JavaScript Files:
script.js or app.js: JavaScript files that add interactivity to the website.
app.js: Used for larger projects to separate functionalities (sometimes structured as modules).

Image Files:
Common image file names might include logos or icons like logo.png, banner.jpg, or favicon.ico.
logo.png, background.jpg: Any image, video, or audio files used in the project.
favicon.ico: The small icon that appears in the browser tab.

sitemap.xml:
An XML file that lists all the pages on the site to help search engines crawl and index the content.

Configuration Files
robots.txt: Provides instructions for search engine crawlers on how to index the site.
.htaccess (for Apache servers): Controls server configurations such as redirects, URL rewriting, etc.

JSON or XML Files
data.json: Stores data to be consumed by the JavaScript code.
manifest.json: Contains metadata about the web app (especially for Progressive Web Apps).

HTML Fragments
header.html, footer.html: Separate files containing common sections of a website, like the header or footer, 
which are often reused across different pages.

To maintain a clean and organized structure, developers often use folders and meaningful names for files:
/css/: Contains CSS files (e.g., main.css).
/js/: Contains JavaScript files (e.g., app.js).
/images/: Contains images (e.g., logo.png).
/pages/: Organizes additional pages (e.g., pages/about.html, pages/contact.html).


Best Practices for Naming HTML Files
Descriptive and Meaningful Names: Names should clearly indicate the content or purpose of the file.
Example: team.html for a page about the team rather than page3.html.
Lowercase and Hyphenated: It's a common convention to use lowercase letters and hyphens (-) instead of spaces or underscores (_) in file names.
Example: services-overview.html is better than ServicesOverview.html or services_overview.html.
