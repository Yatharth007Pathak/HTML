<!--
This HTML file applies internal CSS to style only the <h2> element. The CSS rule sets the font size to 48px, the background color to dark red, 
and the text color to chartreuse. The <h1> element remains unstyled, and its appearance will be in the browser's default style for h1. 
Internal CSS is defined in the <style> tag within the <head> section, making it useful for styling specific elements within the same document.


Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the provided HTML file that uses internal styles:

<!DOCTYPE html>:
This declaration specifies that the document is an HTML5 document, helping browsers render it correctly.

<html>:
This is the opening tag for the HTML document. All elements within this tag are part of the HTML structure.

<head>:
This section contains meta-information about the webpage, including the title and internal CSS styles.

<title>internal styles</title>:
This sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab. In this case, the title is "internal styles."

<style>:
The <style> tag is used to define internal CSS. Styles written inside this tag apply directly to elements on the page.

h2{ font-size: 48px; background-color:darkred; color:chartreuse; }:
This CSS rule targets all <h2> elements and applies the following styles:
font-size: 48px; sets the font size of the h2 text to 48 pixels.
background-color: darkred; applies a dark red background to the h2 element.
color: chartreuse; changes the text color to chartreuse (a bright green shade).

</style>:
This closing tag marks the end of the internal CSS styles.

</head>:
This closing tag marks the end of the head section.

<body>:
This tag starts the body section of the document, where all visible content will be placed.

<h1>This is unstyled text</h1>:
This is an h1 tag that creates a top-level heading. The text "This is unstyled text" will be displayed in its default style, 
with no specific CSS applied.

<h2>This is styled text</h2>:
This is an h2 tag that creates a second-level heading. The text "This is styled text" will be displayed with the internal CSS styles 
defined in the <style> tag. It will appear in 48px font size, with a dark red background and chartreuse (bright green) text color.

</body>:
This closing tag marks the end of the body section of the document.

</html>:
This closing tag marks the end of the HTML document.
