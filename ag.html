HTML headings are used to define the hierarchical structure of a web page's content. 
They indicate the relative importance and organisation of different sections or headings within the document. 
HTML offers six levels of headings, ranging from <h1> (the highest importance) to <h6> (the lowest importance).
Each heading level conveys a specific meaning and should be used appropriately to structure your content.
Here's a brief overview of when to use each heading level:
<h1>: This is the most important heading and should be used for the main title of the page. There should typically be only one <h1> on a page.
<h2>: Used for major section headings that are a level below the main title.
<h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>: These are used for subsections or subheadings within the major sections. 
The importance decreases as the heading level number increases.

HTML paragraphs are used to group blocks of text together in a structured manner.
They are represented by the <p> element and create a new paragraph each time they are used.
Paragraphs are essential for organising content and making it easier to read and understand.
You can use HTML paragraphs to create clear and organized structure for your web pages. They can also be used to group related content together.
Here are some additional tips for using HTML paragraphs:
Use paragraphs to separate different sections of content.
Use paragraphs to group related content together.
Use consistent paragraph formatting throughout your web page.
Use paragraphs to make your web pages more readable.
