This HTML file demonstrates the use of internal CSS to style elements. The <style> tag in the <head> section applies styling 
to all <h1> elements, changing the font size to 24 pixels, the background color to teal, and the text color to orangered. 
A paragraph is also included, showing how to insert a line break within a paragraph using <br>.


Here's a detailed line-by-line breakdown of the provided HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html>:
This declaration defines the document type as HTML5, ensuring the correct rendering of the webpage in browsers.

<html>:
This opening tag starts the HTML document, containing everything that makes up the webpage.

<head>:
This section contains meta-information about the document, including the title and any internal styles.

<title>Internal Styles</title>:
This sets the title of the webpage, which will appear in the browser tab. The title here is "Internal Styles."

<style>:
This tag opens a section where internal CSS is defined. 
Internal CSS is placed within the <style> tag and allows you to style elements directly within the HTML file.

h1{ font-size: 24px; background-color: teal; color: orangered; }:
This CSS rule targets all <h1> elements on the page and applies the following styles:
font-size: 24px; sets the font size of the h1 elements to 24 pixels.
background-color: teal; applies a teal background color to the h1 elements.
