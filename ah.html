HTML styles are used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements. They can be used to change the font, color, size, 
and other properties of text. They can also be used to add borders, backgrounds, and other effects to elements.
There are three ways to add styles to HTML elements:

Inline styles: Applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute. 
This method affects only the specific element where it's applied.

Internal Styles: Defined within a <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document. 
This method affects all elements of a specific type throughout the webpage.

External Styles: Defined in a separate CSS file, which is linked to the HTML document using a <link> tag. 
This method allows for consistent styling across multiple pages.

This HTML file creates a webpage that includes a paragraph of text, where one line is followed by another using a line break (<br>), 
and a heading styled with inline CSS to change its size and color. The heading is displayed in green with a font size of 24px.


Here's a detailed line-by-line breakdown of this HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html>:
Specifies the document type as HTML5, which is the current standard version of HTML.

<html>:
The opening tag for the entire HTML document. Everything within this tag is part of the HTML structure.

<head>:
Contains meta-information (such as title, scripts, and links to stylesheets) about the document that is not visible on the webpage itself.

<title>html style</title>:
Sets the title of the webpage. This title will appear in the browser tab. In this case, it is "html style."

</head>:
This tag closes the head section of the document.

<body>:
The opening tag for the body of the document. Everything within this tag is content that will be displayed on the webpage.

<p>This is a paragraph with multiple lines of text <br>:
This is a paragraph tag (<p>) containing some text.
Inside the paragraph, the <br> tag is used to insert a line break without starting a new paragraph.

This is the second line of text.</p>:
This text will appear on a new line because of the <br> tag in the previous line, but it's still part of the same paragraph. 
The </p> tag closes the paragraph.

<h1 style="font-size: 24px; color:green;">This is a heading</h1>:
This is an h1 tag, used to define the largest heading. The style attribute is used to apply inline CSS directly within the tag.
The font-size: 24px; sets the font size of the heading to 24 pixels.
The color: green; sets the text color of the heading to green.
The text "This is a heading" will be displayed as a large, green-colored heading.

</body>:
This tag closes the body section of the document.

</html>:
This tag closes the HTML document structure.
