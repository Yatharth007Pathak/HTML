<!--
HTML tables are used to display data in a tabular format. They are made up of rows and columns, and each cell in the table can contain text,
images, or other elements. HTML tables are defined with the <table> tag. The <table> tag is placed in the <body> section of the HTML document. 
The <table> tag has a number of attributes that can be used to control the appearance of the table, such as the width, height, and border.
The <table> tag can contain a number of other tags, including the <tr> tag, the <th> tag and the <td> tag. 
The <tr> tag defines a row in the table. The <th> tag defines a header cell in the table. The <td> tag defines a data cell in the table.


<table>: This is the container element for the entire table.
<tr>: This represents a table row, which contains table cells either header cells or data cells. Each row of the table starts with this element.
<th>: This is used to create header cells. It provides bold and centered text by default.
td>: This represents data cells. It contains the actual data to be displayed in the table.

Tables can have multiple rows (<tr>) and columns (<th> and <td>). 
You can create complex tables by merging cells, adding headers, and applying different styling through CSS.

<!--
This HTML file creates a simple table to display employee information, including columns for Name, Employee Id, and Gender. 
The table is styled with a black border around each cell, giving it a clear structure. 
The table contains three rows of data for three employees: Augustus, Charlie, and Violet.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the HTML file that creates a table to display employee information:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares that the document is using HTML5.

<html lang="en">: Defines the root of the HTML document, with lang="en" indicating that the language is English.

<head>: Contains meta-information about the document.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8 to support a wide range of characters.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: 
Ensures the page is responsive by setting the viewport properties to match the device's width.

<title>HTML tables</title>: Sets the title of the webpage to "HTML tables," which appears in the browser tab.

<style>: Contains CSS styles for the table.

table, tr, td, th { border: 1px solid black; }:
This CSS rule applies a 1-pixel solid black border to the table itself, table rows (<tr>), table data cells (<td>), and table headers (<th>).

</head>: Ends the head section.
