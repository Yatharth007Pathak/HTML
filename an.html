<P><strong>This text is important!</strong></P>:
This paragraph uses the <strong> tag, which indicates that the text is of strong importance.

which typically renders the text with a yellow background to indicate it is highlighted or relevant.

This paragraph shows the use of the <del> tag, which indicates that "blue" has been deleted or is no longer relevant. 
The text will appear with a strikethrough effect.

making it smaller and lower than the baseline of the surrounding text.

This paragraph contains the <sup> tag, which renders the text "superscripted" in superscript format, 
making it smaller and higher than the baseline of the surrounding text.
