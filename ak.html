<!--
This HTML file demonstrates how to use external CSS by linking to a separate stylesheet (styles.css) using the <link> tag. 
The CSS rules in styles.css will apply to the content in the HTML file. 
The <p> and <h1> elements in the body will be styled according to the rules defined in the external stylesheet, 
making it easier to maintain and organize styles separately from the HTML structure.


Hereâ€™s a detailed line-by-line breakdown of the provided HTML file that links to an external CSS file:

<!DOCTYPE html>:
This declaration defines the document type as HTML5, ensuring correct rendering by browsers.

<html>:
This is the opening tag for the HTML document. It encloses all content and elements of the webpage.

<head>:
This section contains meta-information about the webpage, such as the title and links to external resources like CSS or JavaScript files.

<title>External Styles</title>:
This sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab. In this case, the title is "External Styles."

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">:
This line links the HTML document to an external CSS file.
rel="stylesheet" specifies that the file being linked is a stylesheet (CSS).
href="styles.css" defines the path to CSS file. The browser will load the styles from this external file and apply them to the HTML document.
The CSS file named styles.css should be stored in the same directory as the HTML file or in the correct specified path.

</head>:
This closing tag ends the head section of the document.

<body>:
This opening tag begins the body section, where the visible content of the webpage is placed.

<p>This is a paragraph with multiple lines of text <br>:
This is a paragraph (<p>) containing text. The <br> tag inside the paragraph creates a line break without starting a new paragraph.

This is the second line of text.</p>:
This text continues the paragraph and is placed after the line break. The </p> tag closes the paragraph.

<h1>This is a heading</h1>:
This is h1 tag, which defines top-level heading. The text "This is a heading" will be displayed prominently as the largest heading on the page. 
The styling for this heading will be defined in the external CSS file (styles.css).

</body>:
This closing tag marks the end of the body section.

</html>:
This closing tag indicates the end of the HTML document.
