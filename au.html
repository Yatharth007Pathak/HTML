A favicon (short for "favourite icon") is a small icon that is displayed in the browser tab and in the bookmarks bar. 
Favicons are a great way to brand your website and make it easier for users to identify your site.

To add a favicon to your HTML document, you need to include the following code in the <head> section of your document:
The href attribute of <link> tag specifies the location of the favicon file. The favicon file should be a small image file, such as a .ico file.
You can also use the rel="icon" attribute instead of the rel="shortcut icon" attribute. 
The rel="icon" attribute is more recent and is supported by most browsers.

This HTML file demonstrates how to:
Add a favicon to a webpage by using the <link> element in the head section, pointing to a PNG image file located in the /images folder.
The body contains a single paragraph with the text "I know what a favicon is."
The favicon will be displayed in the browser's tab next to the webpage title, and its path is specified relative to the root directory.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the HTML file that introduces a favicon:

<!DOCTYPE html>:
Declares that the document is using HTML5.

<html lang="en">:
The <html> tag defines the root of the HTML document, with lang="en" indicating that the language of the page is English.

<head>:
Contains metadata about the HTML document.

<meta charset="UTF-8">:
Specifies that the document uses UTF-8 character encoding, which supports a wide range of characters.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:

<title>Favicon</title>:
Defines the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab as "Favicon".

<link rel="icon" href="/images/favicon.png">:

rel="icon" specifies the relationship between the document and the linked resource, indicating that this is the favicon for the page.
href="/images/favicon.png" specifies the path to the favicon image file. This path assumes that the image is located in an /images directory.
Favicons are the small icons that appear next to the title of a webpage in the browser tab.
