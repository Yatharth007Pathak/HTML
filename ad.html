The structure of an HTML document follows a specific, hierarchical format to organize and display content on the web. 
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key components:

1. DOCTYPE Declaration
The document starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document. 
It must be the first line in any HTML document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. They define the structure and content of the page.
Each HTML element has a specific purpose and function.

2. HTML Tag (<html> and </html>)
The entire content of the webpage is enclosed within the <html> tag. It acts as the root element for the HTML document.
All other elements are nested within it. It contains two main sections: <head> and <body>

3. Head Section (<head> and </head>)
The <head> section contains metadata and other elements that provide information about the webpage but are not displayed directly to the user. 
It contains meta-information about the web page, such as page title, links to external resouces(CSS, JS), and character encoding declaration.
This section can include:
Title: The text that appears on the browser tab.
Meta Tags: For character encoding, viewport settings, SEO, etc.
Link Tags: For linking external stylesheets.
Script Tags: For including external or internal JavaScript.

4. Common tags inside the Head
<title>: Sets the title of the webpage displayed in the browser tab.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document, ensuring proper display of text.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Controls the layout on mobile browsers for responsive design.
<meta name="description" content="Your page description here">: Provides a summary of the webpage for search engines and social media.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">: Links to an external CSS file for styling the webpage.
<script src="script.js"></script>: Links to an external JavaScript file for adding interactivity and functionality.
<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">: Specifies relevant keywords for search engine optimization (SEO).

5. Body Section (<body> and </body>)
The <body> section contains the content that is visible to the user on the webpage, such as text, images, links, and other multimedia. 
It is where most HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and forms are placed.

HTML is a text-based language, which means that it is made up of text and tags. 
Tags are used to mark up the text in a way that tells the browser how to display it.

6. Common Tags Inside the Body
Headings (<h1> to <h6>): Used for defining different levels of headings on the page, <h1> being the most important and <h6> the least important.
Paragraphs (<p>): Used for blocks of text. Represent a paragraph of text.
Images (<img>): Embed images. The tag is used to insert an image.
Links (<a>): Creates a hyperlink to another web page or resource. the href attribute specifies the URL.
Divs and Spans (<div> and <span>): Containers for structuring content.
Lists (<ul>, <ol>, and <li>): Unordered and ordered lists.
Forms (<form>): For user input.
Break (<br>): Used to insert a line break in text.


In HTML, tags are used to define elements on a webpage. Most HTML tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
Opening Tag: Marks the beginning of an element. It consists of the element's name enclosed in angle brackets (< >).
Example of an opening tag for a paragraph: <p>
Closing Tag: Marks the end of an element. It looks like the opening tag but includes a forward slash (/) before the element's name.
Example of a closing tag for a paragraph: </p>

Example: 
Paragraph (<p></p>): Used for defining paragraphs of text.
Heading (<h1></h1>, <h2></h2>, etc.): Used for headings with different levels of importance.
Div (<div></div>): Used as a container to group elements for styling or layout purposes.
Anchor (<a></a>): Used for creating hyperlinks.
List Item (<li></li>): Used to represent an item in a list, usually inside <ul> or <ol>.


Self-closing tags are HTML elements that do not require a closing tag because they do not wrap any content. They are written with a single tag.
Examples of Self-Closing Tags:
<br>: Inserts a line break.
<img>: Embeds an image in the webpage.
<hr>: Inserts a horizontal rule (a horizontal line).
<input>: Represents an input field in a form.
<meta>: Provides metadata about the HTML document.
<link>: Links an external resource like a CSS file.
