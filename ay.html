<!--
In HTML, elements can be categorized as either "block-level" or "inline" elements based on their default behaviour 
and the way they interact with other elements.

Block-level Elements: Block-level elements are HTML elements that create a block-level box on the web page. 
This means they typically start on a new line and take up the full available width of their parent container. 
Block-level elements are often used to create major structural components of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, divs, lists, and sections.
By default, block-level elements have a width of 100% of their parent container. 
They will stretch horizontally to fill the entire available width, pushing other elements to the next line.

Inline Elements: Inline elements are HTML elements that do not create a new block-level box. 
They typically flow within the content and do not force a new line.
Inline elements are used to style or wrap smaller parts of the content within block-level elements.
Example of inline elements include span, anchor, strong, emphasis, italic, bold etc.
Inline elements only take up the space they need, so multiple inline elements can appear on the same line.
They are commonly used for styling text or adding inline links to the content.

This HTML document demonstrates the use of both block-level and inline elements. 
Block-level elements such as <div>, <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <section> create separate sections on the page that take up the full width available. 
Inline elements such as <span>, <a>, <em>, <i>, and <b> allow text to flow inline without breaking into a new line. 
This structure is essential for organizing content effectively in web development.


Here's a breakdown of the HTML file demonstrating block-level and inline elements:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document as HTML5.

<html lang="en">: Defines the root of the HTML document, specifying English as the language.

<head>: Contains meta-information about the document.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Sets the character encoding to UTF-8 to support a wide range of characters.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: 
Ensures the page is responsive by setting the viewport properties to match the device's width.

<title>HTML Block and Inline</title>: Sets the title of the webpage to "HTML Block and Inline," which appears in the browser tab.

</head>: Ends the head section.

<body>: Begins the body section where visible content is placed.

<div>This is a block-level section.</div>: Creates a block-level section. A <div> element is commonly used as a container for grouping content.
<h1>This is a block-level heading.</h1>: Creates a block-level heading. The <h1> tag is used for the main title or most important heading.
<p>This is a block-level paragraph.</p>: Creates a block-level paragraph. The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text.
<ul>: Starts an unordered list (bulleted list).
<li>This is a block-level item1</li>: Defines a list item for the unordered list as "This is a block-level item1."
<li>This is a block-level item2</li>: Defines another list item for the unordered list as "This is a block-level item2."
</ul>: Closes the unordered list.
<section>This is a block-level section</section>: Creates a block-level section. The <section> tag is typically used to group related content.

    Inline Elements
<span>This is an inline element.</span>: Defines an inline element that can be used for styling a part of the text without breaking the flow. 
A <span> is often used for applying styles to small sections of text.
<a href="#">This is an inline link.</a>: Creates an inline hyperlink. The <a> tag is used to define a link, 
with href="#" making it a placeholder link.
<em>This is an inline text with emphasis.</em>: Creates an inline element that emphasizes the text, typically rendering it in italics.
<i>This is an inline text with italic.</i>: Creates an inline element that styles the text in italics.
