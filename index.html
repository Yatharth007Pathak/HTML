Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites or web applications that are accessible over the internet. 
It involves several aspects, from front-end development (what users see and interact with) to back-end development 
(the server-side logic and database management).

Key Components of Web Development:

Front-End Development:
HTML: Defines the structure of the webpage.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity, such as animations, form validations, and dynamic content updates.
Front-end developers focus on user experience (UX) and ensure that websites are responsive, 
meaning they work well across different devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

Back-End Development:
Involves the server-side logic that powers a website. It deals with databases, server communication, and application logic. 
Common back-end technologies include:
Programming languages: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, Node.js, etc.
Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.
Web servers: Apache, Nginx.
Back-end developers ensure that data is stored, retrieved, and processed correctly, enabling features like user authentication, 
data submission, and e-commerce functionality.

Full-Stack Development:
A full-stack developer handles both front-end and back-end development. 
They work on the entire web application from designing the user interface to managing databases and server-side logic.

Web Design:
A part of web development that focuses on designing the aesthetics and layout of a website, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
Web designers use tools like Adobe XD, Figma, or Sketch for mockups and prototypes.

Database Management:
Websites often need to store data, such as user information, blog posts, or e-commerce transactions. 
Databases are used to store and retrieve this information.

DevOps and Deployment:
Managing the infrastructure where websites are hosted, including server management, security, 
and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Popular services include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.

Frameworks and Libraries:
Web developers use frameworks and libraries to streamline the development process:
Front-end frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.js.
Back-end frameworks: Django, Flask (Python), Express (Node.js), Ruby on Rails.

Types of Web Development:
Static Websites: Simple websites with fixed content that doesn't change dynamically (e.g., a personal portfolio).
Dynamic Websites: Websites with interactive features, such as user accounts, blogs, and e-commerce sites 
(e.g., social media platforms, online stores).
Web Applications: More complex applications that function like desktop software but are accessed through a web browser (eg- Gmail, Google Docs).

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. 
HTML functions as a markup language for crafting web pages.
Its purpose is to define the layout and components found on a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists and images.
It defines the structure of a webpage by using a system of elements (tags), which tell the browser how to display the content. 
HTML elements are typically represented by opening and closing tags, and they can include text, images, links, tables, forms, and more.
HTML is often used alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for functionality) to create modern, interactive websites.

Key components of HTML:
Tags: Denote elements, e.g., <h1>, <p>, <a>.
Attributes: Provide additional information about elements, e.g., href in <a>.
Document structure: Includes the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My first web page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hare Krishna, This is my first website!</h1>
</body>
</html>

HTML comments are used to add notes to HTML code that are not displayed in the browser.
Anything between <!–– and ––> is treated as a comment and is ignored by the browser when rendering the page. 
We can use comments to explain sections of your code, leave notes, provide instructions, leave a reminder for yourself 
or temporarily disable pieces of HTML without deleting them.

<!-- 
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines in the HTML file.

The index.html file is the default or main HTML file that is loaded when a web server serves a website. 
It is typically the entry point of a website, meaning that when you visit a domain (like www.example.com), 
the server looks for a file named index.html to display as the home page or landing page.

Key Features of index.html
Default Web Page: Most web servers are configured to automatically look for index.html in the root directory of a website. 
If found, it is served as the default page when no specific file is requested. 
For example, visiting http://www.example.com/ will load index.html if no other path is specified. 
Homepage: It often contains the main content and layout for the homepage of a website. 
Other pages may link to it, and it may link to other HTML files that make up the rest of the site.
File Structure: In a typical website project, the index.html file is placed in the root directory (main folder) of the project.

Standard Naming Convention: The name "index" comes from the idea that it is an "index" or starting point of the website. 
Web servers are typically set up to look for a file named index.html (or similar, such as index.php) by default when serving a directory.
SEO and Usability: Having a single, standardized entry point (index.html) makes it easier for users and search engines 
to access the main content of your website.

When to Use index.html
Single-page Sites: For simple websites or landing pages, you may only have an index.html file.
Multi-page Sites: Even in larger websites, index.html serves as the main entry page. 
Other pages will have their own .html files (like about.html, contact.html, etc.), but the index.html page is still the home page.
