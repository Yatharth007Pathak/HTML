<!--
HTML uses the <img> tag to add images to webpages. 
Images can be used to enhance the visual appeal of a website and are commonly used to display photos, illustrations, logos, and other graphics.

This HTML file demonstrates two things:
A hyperlink to Instagram using the <a> tag with the target="_blank" attribute, which opens the Instagram website in a new tab.
An image embedded on the page using the <img> tag. The image is sourced from an external URL, displayed at 200x200 pixels. 
It includes an alternative text for accessibility and a title for a tooltip when hovering over the image.


Hereâ€™s a detailed line-by-line breakdown of the HTML file that demonstrates how to use both a hyperlink and an image:

<!DOCTYPE html>:
This declaration specifies that the document is an HTML5 document, ensuring that browsers render it correctly.

<html lang="en">:
This is the opening tag for the HTML document, with the lang attribute set to "en," indicating that the content is primarily in English.

<head>:
This section contains meta-information about the document, including the title and character settings.

<meta charset="UTF-8">:
This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document, ensuring that text is displayed correctly using the UTF-8 character set.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:
This meta tag sets the viewport for responsive design, ensuring that the webpage scales correctly on different devices, especially mobile.

<title>HTML Images</title>:
This tag sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab. Here, the title is "HTML Images."

</head>:
This closing tag marks the end of the head section.

<body>:
This opening tag begins the body section, where the visible content of the webpage is placed.

<a href="https://instagram.com" target="_blank">Visit instagram website</a>:
This line creates a hyperlink to Instagram's website:
The href="https://instagram.com" attribute specifies the URL (Instagram in this case).
The target="_blank" attribute makes the link open in a new tab.
The text between the <a> tags, "Visit instagram website," is what the user clicks to open the link.

<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/08/05/11/16/logo-2582748_640.png" height="200" width="200" alt="html image" title="Sample image.">:
This line adds an image to the webpage using the <img> tag:
src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/08/05/11/16/logo-2582748_640.png" specifies the source URL of the image 
(a link to an image hosted on Pixabay).
height="200" and width="200" set the height and width of the image in pixels, respectively (200x200 pixels in this case).
alt="html image" provides alternative text that will be shown if the image cannot be displayed. 
This also helps with accessibility, describing the image for screen readers.
title="Sample image." adds a tooltip that will appear when the user hovers over the image. It gives additional information about the image.

</body>:
This closing tag marks the end of the body section of the document.

</html>:
This closing tag indicates the end of the HTML document.
